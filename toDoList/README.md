This is a simple ToDoList application that allows users to create, view, update and delete to-do items. The application allows users to sign up for an account, log in and start creating to-do lists.


### Features

- User registration and login
- Create, view, update and delete to-do items
- Create to-do lists by category
- Assign to-do items to different lists
- Mark to-do items as completed
- Search for to-do items
- Search by to-do lists by category
- Search to-do items by due-date



## How to use the Project:
1. Clone the project from the repository to your local machine: 
   - ssh: `git@github.com:XixianWei/back_end_project_toDoList.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory in the command line.
3. Once the project is running, navigate to localhost:8080 in your web browser or Postman.
4. From there, you can register a new user account or log in to an existing account.
5. Once you're logged in, you can create new to-do lists and add to-dos to those lists.
6. You can view all of your to-do lists and to-dos, edit them, or delete them as needed.



### What was our motivation?
Our motivation for developing a to-do list application was to help users keep track of their tasks and improve their productivity. To-do list applications can also be useful for organizations to manage their projects and improve team collaboration. Additionally, developing a to-do list application can be a good exercise in software development and provide experience with technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL.
